            <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
            <p>
                Students in this course will gain a comprehensive understanding of cloud computing and its applications in modern IT environments.  
                We will be using the Microsoft Azure platform to explore core concepts, services, and management strategies in cloud computing.
                By the end of the course, students will be able to:
            </p>
            <ul><li>Understand the core concepts of cloud computing and its significance in modern IT environments.</li> 
            <li>Gain a comprehensive understanding of cloud concepts and their applications in modern computing environments.</li>
            <li>Explore cloud computing models, pricing structures, and service types to effectively utilize cloud resources.</li>
            </ul>
            Optionally, students may choose to take the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification exam (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-900">AZ-900</a>) at the end of the course.
